"AB In this paper, we extend the models in the literature [Lee, H.L., So, K.C., Tang, C., 2000. The value of information sharing in a two-level supply chain. Management Science 46 (5), 626-643; Raghunathan, S., Yell, A.B., 2001. Beyond EDI: impact of continuous replenishment program (CRP) between a manufacturer and its retailers. Information Systems Research 12 (4), 406-419] to analyze the benefits realized for manufacturers and retailers under information sharing(IS), continuous replenishment programs (CRP) or vendor managed inventory (VMI) and compare the distribution of benefits between manufacturers and retailers. Our analysis shows that IS, CRP, and VMI bring varying benefits in terms of inventory cost savings to firms, and that the benefits are not consistently distributed between retailers and manufacturers. Our findings also point to the managerial implications Oil how managers may decide the product sets and replenishment frequency for improved benefit realization under CRP and VMI.

"to the supplier. To ensure abundant supply, the retailer has an incentive to inflate her soft-orders, which potentially harms the credible information sharing and sustainability of business cooperation. Normally, the degree to which the supplier relies on the retailer's order information is specified by trust, which is evaluated according to the retailer's reputation and supplier's intuition in this study. Based on standard game theory, we find that both the retailer's order and the quantity of supplier prepared materials are independent of the retailer's forecast. Therefore, EDI based information sharing in e-commerce without a regulation mechanism leads to inefficient demand information sharing. Since both the supplier and retailer are proved to faces huge of potential profit losses due to the failure of information sharing, the commerce by EDI based information sharing is full of risk and unsustainable. Therefore, a regulation mechanism that leaded by the retailer is proposed to establish 'win-win' sustainable cooperation. Numerical experiments highlight the value of trust, the impact of reputation and intuition in decisions, and the effectiveness of the regulation mechanism by a cost-sharing contract.",0.00038899481631455695

"AB The need for continual value innovation is driving supply chains to evolve from a pure transactional focus to leveraging interorganizational partner ships for sharing information and, ultimately, market knowledge creation. Supply chain partners are (1) engaging in interlinked processes that enable rich (broad-ranging, high quality, and privileged) information sharing, and (2) building information technology infrastructures that allow them to process information obtained from their partners to create new knowledge. This study uncovers and examines the variety of supply chain partnership configurations that exist based on differences in capability platforms, reflecting varying processes and information systems. We use the absorptive capacity lens to build a conceptual framework that links these configurations with partner-enabled market knowledge creation. Absorptive capacity refers to the set of organizational routines and processes by which organizations acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge to produce dynamic organizational capabilities.",0.00038899481631455695

"when non-optimal forecasting methods are employed by supply chains. We show that in the case of a simple moving average forecast, the demand at the downstream link can be inferred. In the case of single exponential smoothing (SES), downstream demand cannot be inferred and thus needs to be shared. Finally, we quantify the value of sharing demand information when SES is employed.",0.00038899481631455695

"allows the upstream actor to infer the demand received by the downstream actor without the need of information sharing. Recent research showed that DDI is possible with Simple Moving Average (SMA) forecast method, and was verified for an autoregressive [AR(1)] demand process, a moving average [MAW] demand process, and an autoregressive moving average [ARMA(1, 1)] demand process. In this paper, we extend the strategy's results by considering causal invertible [ARMA(p, q)] demand processes. We develop Mean Squared Error and Average Inventory level expressions for [ARMA(p, q)] demand under DDI strategy, No Information Sharing (NIS) and Forecast Information Sharing (FIS) strategies. We compute the Bullwhip effect generated by employing SMA method and we simulate the resulted improvement compared to employing MMSE method. We analyze the sensibility of the three performance metrics in respect with lead-time value, SMA and ARMA(p, q) parameters. We compare DDI results with NIS and FIS strategies' results and we show experimentally that DDI generally outperforms NIS. Finally, we provide a revenue sharing contract as a practical recommendation to incite supply chain managers to adopt DDI strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0.00038899481631455695
